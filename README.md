# MySolarSystem3D
Using Ursina Engine in Python, i created this for study and testing.


# Notes

- 1. The trajectory of each planet is a circle
    
- 2. It takes the same amount of time for the 9 planets to revolve around the sun
    
- 3. Each planet is 40 degree apart from its two neighboring planets because we have 9 planets, and 360/9 = 40
